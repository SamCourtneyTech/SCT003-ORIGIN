# ORIGIN (SCT#003)

A digital audio effects plugin that allows users to implement custom DSP algorithms using MATLAB-style equation syntax.

## Overview

ORIGIN enables musicians and audio engineers to create custom audio effects by writing DSP equations in MATLAB language syntax. Users can implement various types of filters, audio processors, and even oscillation-based effects through an intuitive equation interface.

## Features

- **MATLAB Syntax Support**: Write DSP equations using familiar MATLAB language constructs
- **Filter Implementation**: Create custom filters (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch, etc.)
- **Audio Effects**: Implement delays, reverbs, distortion, modulation effects, and more
- **Oscillation Effects**: Generate oscillation-based effects like LFOs, tremolo, vibrato
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency audio processing suitable for live performance
- **DAW Integration**: Works as a standard audio effects plugin in your favorite DAW

### Educational Features (Optional)

- **Mathematical Equation Display**: Automatically visualize mathematical equations and functions for DSP learning
- **Unit Circle Diagrams**: Interactive unit circle visualizations for understanding frequency response
- **Z-Plane Diagrams**: Pole-zero plots for analyzing filter stability and characteristics
- **Block Diagrams**: Visual representation of DSP signal flow and processing chains

## Plugin Type

This is an **audio effects plugin**, not a synthesizer. It processes incoming audio signals through user-defined DSP equations to create modified output.

## Use Cases

- Custom filter design
- Experimental audio processing
- Educational DSP learning with visual feedback
- Prototype development for audio effects
- Creative sound design
- Academic research and teaching
- DSP concept visualization and understanding
